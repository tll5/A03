[(I.) Webstorm, Git, and GitHub Tutorial:]

[Downloading the Necessary Programs:]
- Download Webstorm from https://www.jetbrains.com/student/
- Create a GitHub account at the site https://github.com/join and enter the following information: Username, email address, and password. Save them!
- Download Git from https://git-scm.com/downloads and click on the .exe file to fully install it.

[Process and workflow:]
- Run Webstorm, and check for any updates (since they may be necessary to properly commit work to Git).
- Navigate to Webstorm’s settings, using the button sequence ‘Ctrl+Alt+S’ 
- Click under ‘Version Control’, or VCS, and choose the Git option to connect Webstorm to Git. 
- Once you see the correct directory path on the top of the settings page under your program files, click the ‘Test’ button. 
- After you see the ‘Git Executed Successfully’ response (if you correctly installed and followed the instructions up to this point), hit ‘OK’. 
- If you did not see the above message, you likely did not install Git correctly and must refer back to earlier in this tutorial. 
- Navigate back to the home page of Webstorm and create a new project under File > New > Project.
- Name it with proper naming conventions for its use and contents, and click ‘create’ to make it under the file directory of your choosing (be sure it is connected to your git and personal file directory on your device). 
- If you want to make a file under this newly named project, you can either: Go to File > New > HTML File > HTML5, or right click on the new project and click New > HTML File (or any other file of your choice). Make sure to name this file in LOWERCASE and have the extension of ‘.html’.
- Once the file is created, you can edit and build on it as needed using your HTML knowledge and proper syntax.
- Add your new project to GitHub by navigating to Git > Share Project on GitHub where you would fill out the correct information needed to connect the project from Webstorm to GitHub. It will read success if your file can be searched successfully in a URL. 

- If you want to save and log changes from Webstorm to GitHub, go to Version Control, which you can set to ‘Git’, and click on the ‘commit’ button. Make sure to always leave a comment for each commit update that specifies what the creation or modification is doing!
- Then navigate to ‘Git’ > ‘Push’ and push the work, which should go to the remote repository of origin/master directly on your GitHub under your repository! This allows the contents to be passed from Git and sent/connected directly to your GitHub.
- You can also create and set repositories to have certain content under Settings > Repository Name as well as other settings that help you create the area on GitHub to commit and push your work from Webstorm through Git.  
- When you make subsequent changes to your files or add new projects in Webstorm after this point, repeat the previous three-four steps. 

[(II.) Glossary:]

- **Branch** - a mirrored piece of a repository that belongs to the repository, but at the same time does not alter the ‘main’ branch. Branches enable you to essentially edit and do different things that you would not want committed to the main branch. But, you can always simply merge the branch into the main branch if you wish, making this a very flexible method of doing work. 
- **Clone** - copying of a repository that you can keep personally and off of GitHub if needed. This allows you to work with the clone offline and then push them to update and ‘re-sync’ the offline changes to remote. 
- **Commit** - a change to a file(s) that allows you to save an instance of the file, containing the content change, time, and its publisher. Every commit must have a message that clarifies and helps the creator specify what the commit did. 
- **Fetch** - grabs changes from your remote repository and puts them into your local space (like a branch) without committing anything to the local space.
- **GIT** - a program that tracks any alterations and changes in text files. It is open source and created by the same creator of Linux OS. 
- **GitHub** - an open source version control system - that keeps track of changes with source code etc. It allows for multiple people to work on the same document simultaneously.
- **Merge** - an action that takes changes from a branch and applies it to another under the same repository. It can be done through a pull request or command line.
- **Merge Conflict** - an inconsistency between merged branches that occur when users make different changes to the same content of a file (editing, deleting, etc.). This cannot exist if you intend to merge the conflicting branches. 
- **Push** - sending forth your previously committed changes to a remote repository directly on GitHub.
- **Pull** - when you fetch in changes and merge them in order to keep different copies of files (local and remote) updated and consistent. 
- **Remote** - the version of the repository or branch that is hosted on a server (such as GitHub.com). Remote versions can be connected to local clones to be synced.
- **Repository** - similar to a folder, where it contains all of a project’s files (including documentation) and stores each file’s revision history. They can be public or private, and are not restricted to a single user.
